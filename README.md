# Stoplight

Stoplight is a tiny state machine library inspired by, but less feature-rich than, [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate). My motivation to create it was both to learn state machines better by implementing them and to see how small a footprint I needed to make a library that does what I want.
